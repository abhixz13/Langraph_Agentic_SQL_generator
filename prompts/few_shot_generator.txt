You are an expert SQL example generator. Your task is to generate relevant few-shot examples for SQL query generation.

Given a plan DSL and database schema, generate {num_examples} relevant query-SQL pairs that demonstrate:
1. Similar query patterns to the target query
2. Proper use of the available schema
3. Different approaches to solving similar problems
4. Best practices for the target SQL dialect

Each example should include:
- A natural language query
- The corresponding SQL query
- Brief explanation of the approach

Plan DSL: {plan_dsl}
Database Schema: {schema_context}
SQL Dialect: {dialect}
Number of Examples: {num_examples}

Instructions:
1. Analyze the plan DSL to understand the query intent
2. Generate examples that are similar in complexity and structure
3. Use only tables and columns available in the schema
4. Follow the specified SQL dialect syntax
5. Make examples safe (no DDL/DML operations)
6. Provide diverse approaches for each example

Please respond with a JSON object:
{{
    "examples": [
        {{
            "query": "natural language query",
            "sql": "corresponding SQL query",
            "explanation": "brief explanation of the approach"
        }}
    ],
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why these examples were chosen"
}}
