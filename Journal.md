**Journal Entry - Updated**

## **1. What Has Been Done Till Now:**
- **Project Setup**: Established the project structure and initialized the environment.
- **Schema Context Agent**: Developed the `schema_context` agent to load database schemas and semantic context.
- **Testing**: Created a comprehensive unit test suite for the `schema_context` node, verifying functionality, caching, and output compliance.
- **Enhanced Schema Context**: Implemented a rich semantic schema using `business_context.json` to provide business context and improve LLM understanding.
- **Contract Compliance**: Ensured the `schema_context` agent aligns with the agent contract, removing unnecessary outputs and clarifying the purpose of each component.
- **Complete Agent Implementation**: Successfully implemented all agent subgraphs (interpret_plan, sql_generate, validate_diagnose, execute, present) with full LLM integration.
- **Workflow Foundation**: Built complete LangGraph workflow with proper state management, routing, and error handling.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Conducted extensive step-by-step testing of the entire workflow, including individual components and end-to-end scenarios.
- **Schema Validation**: Verified correct mapping between natural language queries and actual database schema (raw_data table with proper column mapping).
- **Format Mismatch Resolution**: Fixed critical issue where LLM response format (params structure) wasn't being properly converted to plan validation format.
- **Rich Business Context Integration**: Successfully integrated business context, synonyms, and metrics into schema context for enhanced LLM understanding.
- **Complex SQL Generation**: Verified that the system can generate complex SQL with window functions when given proper plan information.

## **2. Problems Faced:**
- **Missing Semantic Context**: Initially, the `schema_context` agent did not generate a semantic schema, leading to basic outputs without business context.
- **Contract Misalignment**: The contract documentation incorrectly specified the outputs, including `semantic_schema`, which was not part of the state.
- **Error Handling**: The error handling test failed due to incorrect assumptions about the output when a non-existent database was queried.
- **State Management Issues**: AppState vs Dict state handling inconsistencies in LangGraph workflow.
- **Mock vs Real Schema Confusion**: Tests were using mock schemas instead of real database schema, leading to incorrect SQL generation.
- **Wrapper Function Issues**: The wrap_node function wasn't handling AppState objects correctly, causing execution failures.
- **Format Mismatch Issues**: LLM was returning new format (params structure) but plan validation expected old format (flat structure), causing information loss.
- **LLM Interpretation Ambiguity**: LLM defaults to COUNT when "top customers" could mean revenue ranking, leading to incorrect SQL generation.
- **Business Context Underutilization**: Rich business context (synonyms, metrics) not being effectively used by LLM for query interpretation.

## **3. Root Cause:**
- **Lack of Semantic Schema**: The absence of a semantic schema file (`business_context.json`) resulted in the agent generating only basic schema context.
- **Documentation Oversight**: The contract documentation did not accurately reflect the internal workings of the `schema_context` agent, leading to confusion about expected outputs.
- **Implementation Logic**: The logic in the `schema_context_node` did not account for gracefully handling non-existent databases, leading to incorrect status outputs.
- **LangGraph Integration**: LangGraph passes AppState objects to nodes, but wrapper functions expected dictionaries.
- **Test Data Isolation**: Mock schemas were used for testing isolation but didn't reflect real database structure.
- **Patch System**: Nodes were returning regular dictionaries instead of proper patches using create_success_response/create_error_response.
- **Format Evolution**: LLM service evolved to return new format (params structure) but plan validation wasn't updated to handle both formats.
- **Prompt Design Gap**: LLM prompt doesn't effectively guide the model to use business context for ambiguous queries like "top customers".
- **Ambiguity Detection Missing**: System lacks comprehensive ambiguity detection to ask clarifying questions when query intent is unclear.

## **4. How Did You Solve It:**
- **Created Semantic Schema**: Developed the `business_context.json` file to provide rich semantic information, enhancing the schema context.
- **Updated Contract Documentation**: Revised the agent contract to accurately reflect the outputs and internal workings of the `schema_context` agent.
- **Refined Error Handling**: Adjusted the error handling logic in the `schema_context_node` to ensure it returns appropriate responses when querying non-existent databases.
- **Testing and Validation**: Conducted thorough testing to ensure all changes were functioning as expected and aligned with the project goals.
- **Fixed State Management**: Implemented proper AppState handling in wrapper functions and standardized all nodes to return proper patches.
- **Schema Context Resolution**: Created comprehensive test scripts to verify real database schema integration and correct table/column mapping.
- **Workflow Validation**: Conducted step-by-step testing of the entire workflow, ensuring each component works correctly with real data.
- **Error Recovery**: Implemented robust error handling throughout the workflow with proper fallback mechanisms.
- **Format Mismatch Resolution**: Enhanced `validate_intent_response()` function to handle both old and new LLM response formats, preserving all information.
- **Business Context Integration**: Successfully integrated business context, synonyms, and metrics into schema context for enhanced LLM understanding.
- **Complex SQL Verification**: Confirmed that the system can generate complex SQL with window functions when given proper plan information.
- **Issue Identification**: Identified that the remaining issue is LLM interpretation ambiguity, not technical infrastructure problems.
